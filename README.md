# Expense Forecast App

This is an app that calculates your future expenses of up to 7 days. This app is inspired by a fellow Flutter developer named Maximilian from Academind. He has a course on Flutter which covers everything from the basics to advanced topics. And this app is inspired by one of the projects in that course called Personal Expenses and it basically calculates Expenses prior to the day you use the App. So my app is basically the reverse. It also looks very similar so a little disclaimer from me that this project is inspired from Mr. Maximilian and I thank him for that.
